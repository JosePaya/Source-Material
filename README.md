# Source-Material
All Interesting source-material found within and outwith GitHub

Upload ANYTHING you would think is essential for a good developer/programmer. When I say anything I mean A-NY-THING:

Interesting articles, readings, books, online courses, certifications, news, websites, GitHub Projects, etc.

The first approach is going to have a folder for any of the relevant categories (above categories are just examples). As time goes by and repository grows bigger, suggestions and amendments will be made, discussed and actioned accordingly.
