# Source-Material
All Interesting source-material found within and outwith GitHub

Upload ANYTHING you would think is essential for a good developer/programmer. When I say anything I mean A-NY-THING:

Interesting articles, readings, books, online courses, certifications, news, websites, GitHub Projects, etc.

The first approach is going to have a folder for any of the relevant categories (above categories are just examples). As time goes by and repository grows bigger, suggestions and amendments will be made, discussed and actioned accordingly.

Important Note! Please be aware of copyright issues and original creators or publishers when uploading new material. This will be reviewed thoroughly. This is specially important for materials like books. If you're not sure you have the copyright's holder permission, please DO NOT ATTEMPT to commit any new materials.
