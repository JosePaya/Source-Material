+ Publishing Date: 05/2018
+ Instructor: Andrei Neagoie
+ Level: Beginner
+ Main topics: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, REACT.js
+ Observations: Extensive course that touches base on the main modern technologies used in web development. Course conducted by one of the instructors with highest reputation within the Udemy community. Altough it's undeniable that some of the language used during the videos can come across as a little bit inaccurate to more experienced developers or IT professionals I think overall is an excellent introductory course which provides a ton of resources to expand on the contents.
